Hey, I'm Nick Oates, a software engineer with a passion for designing and building cool things on the web. I love obsessing over the small details of my work, and I'm always looking for new things to learn and ways to improve my skills.

I'm a strong believer in internet freedom & privacy, and I believe those values are essential to a healthy, open web. I'm also a big fan of open-source software, reflected in much of [my work](https://nickoates.com/projects).

You can visit [my website](https://nickoates.com/) or follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/nickoates_) to see what I'm working on, or if you'd like to get in touch, send me an email at [nick@nickoates.com](mailto:nick@nickoates.com).
