Hello! I'm Nick, a web developer whose code sometimes works. I enjoy designing and building cool things, and my best work is displayed over on [my projects page](https://nickoates.com/projects). If you'd like to get in touch, email me at [nick@nickoates.com](mailto:nick@nickoates.com).

I'm also a big fan of [internet privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy) and [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), and I believe that those values are essential to a healthy web.
